# AnimaMundiEngine-
The Anima Mundi Engine (AME) is a mathematical framework for mapping the phenomenology of awareness onto an 8D state space. Using dynamical systems, it tracks cognitive trajectories and identifies attractor basins across AI and human architectures. A shared coordinate system for the "texture" of experience and comparative consciousness research.
